JsonSerde - a read/write SerDe for JSON Data
================================================
Build Status:
* master : [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rcongiu/Hive-JSON-Serde.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rcongiu/Hive-JSON-Serde)
* develop:[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rcongiu/Hive-JSON-Serde.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/rcongiu/Hive-JSON-Serde)

This library enables Apache Hive to read and write in JSON format. It includes support for serialization and
deserialization (SerDe) as well as JSON conversion UDF.

### Features

* Read data stored in JSON format
* Convert data to JSON format during `INSERT INTO <table>`
* Support for JSON arrays and maps
* Support for nested data structures
* Support for Cloudera's Distribution Including Apache Hadoop (CDH)
* Support for multiple versions of Hadoop

### Installation

Download the latest binaries (`json-serde-X.Y.Z-jar-with-dependencies.jar` and `json-udf-X.Y.Z-jar-with-dependencies.jar`)
from [congiu.net/hive-json-serde](http://www.congiu.net/hive-json-serde).
Choose the correct verson for CDH 4, CDH 5 or Hadoop 2.3. Place the JARs into `hive/lib` or use `ADD JAR` in Hive.

### JSON Data Files

Upload JSON files to HDFS with `hadoop fs -put` or `LOAD DATA LOCAL`. JSON records in data files
must appear _one per line_, an empty line would produce a NULL record. This is because Hadoop partitions
files as text using CR/LF as a separator to distribute work.

The following example will work.

```json
{ "key" : 10 }
{ "key" : 20 }
```

The following example will not work.

```json
{
  "key" : 10
}
{
  "key" : 20
}
```

### Loading a JSON File and Querying Data

Uses [json-serde/src/test/scripts/test-without-cr-lf.json](json-serde/src/test/scripts/test-without-cr-lf.json).

```
~$ cat test.json

{"text":"foo","number":123}
{"text":"bar","number":345}

$ hadoop fs -put -f test.json /user/data/test.json

$ hive

hive> CREATE DATABASE test;

hive> CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE test ( text string )
      ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
      LOCATION '/user/data';

hive> SELECT * FROM test;
OK

foo 123
bar 345
```

### Querying Complex Fields

Uses [json-serde/src/test/scripts/data.txt](json-serde/src/test/scripts/data.txt).

```
hive> CREATE DATABASE test;

hive> CREATE TABLE test (
        one boolean,
        three array<string>,
        two double,
        four string )
      ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
      STORED AS TEXTFILE;

hive> LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'data.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE test;

hive> select three[1] from test;

gold
yellow
```

If you have complex json it can be tedious to create tables manually.
Try [hive-json-schema](https://github.com/quux00/hive-json-schema) to build your schema from data.

See [json-serde/src/test/scripts](json-serde/src/test/scripts) for more examples.

### Defining Nested Structures

```sql
ADD JAR json-serde-1.3.7-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar;

CREATE TABLE json_nested_test (
	country string,
	languages array<string>,
	religions map<string,array<int>>)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
STORED AS TEXTFILE;

-- data : {"country":"Switzerland","languages":["German","French","Italian"],
-- "religions":{"catholic":[10,20],"protestant":[40,50]}}

LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'nesteddata.txt' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE  json_nested_test;

select * from json_nested_test;

-- result: Switzerland	["German","French","Italian"]	{"catholic":[10,20],"protestant":[40,50]}

select languages[0] from json_nested_test;
-- result: German

select religions['catholic'][0] from json_nested_test;
-- result: 10
```

### Using Arrays

Data in JSON arrays should be ordered identically to Hive columns, similarly to text/csv.

For example, array data as follows.

```js
["John", 26 ]
["Mary", 23 ]
```

Can be imported into the following table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (name string, age int)
```

Arrays can also be nested.

```sql
CREATE TABLE complex_array (
	name string, address struct<street:string,city:string>
)

-- data:
["John", { street:"10 green street", city:"Paris" } .. ]
```

### Importing Malformed Data

The SerDe will raise exceptions with malformed data. For example, the following malformed JSON will raise
`org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.SerDeException`.

```json
{"country":"Italy","languages" "Italian","religions":{"catholic":"90"}}
```

```
Failed with exception java.io.IOException:org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.SerDeException:
Row is not a valid JSON Object - JSONException: Expected a ':' after a key at 32 [character 33 line 1]
```

This may not be desirable if you have a few bad lines you wish to ignore. Set `ignore.malformed.json` in that case.

```sql
ALTER TABLE json_table SET SERDEPROPERTIES ( "ignore.malformed.json" = "true");
```

While this option will not make the query fail, a NULL record will be inserted instead.

```
NULL	NULL	NULL
```

### Promoting a Scalar to an Array

It is a common issue to have a field that sometimes is a scalar and sometimes an array.

```json
{ "field" : "hello", .. }
{ "field" : [ "hello", "world" ], ...
```

Declare your table as `array<string>`, the SerDe will return a one-element array of the right type, promoting the scalar.

### Support for UNIONTYPE

A `Uniontype` is a field that can contain different types. Hive usually stores a 'tag' that is basically the index
of the datatype. For example, if you create a `uniontype<int,string,float>`, a tag would be 0 for int, 1 for string,
2 for float as per the [UnionType documentation](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-UnionTypes).

JSON data does not store anything describing the type, so the SerDe will try and infer it. The order matters.
For example, if you define a field `f` as `UNIONTYPE<int,string>` you will get different results.

The following data will be parsed as `int`, since it precedes the `String` type in the defintion and `123` is
successfully parsed as a number.

```json
{ "f": "123" }
```

The following data will parsed as a `String`.

```json
{ "f": "asv" }
```

It's worth noting that complex `Union` types may not be very efficient, since the SerDe may try to parse the same
data in multiple ways.

### Mapping Hive Keywords

Sometimes JSON data has attributes named like reserved words in hive. For instance, you may have a JSON attribute
named 'timestamp', and hive will fail when issuing a `CREATE TABLE`. This SerDe can map hive columns over attributes
with different names using properties.

In the following example `mapping.ts` translates the `ts` field into it the JSON attribute called `timestamp`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable (
	myfield string, ts string
) ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ( "mapping.ts" = "timestamp" )
STORED AS TEXTFILE;
```

### Mapping Names with Periods

Hive doesn't support column names containing periods. In theory they should work when quoted in backtics, but
doesn't, as noted in [SO#35344480](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35344480/hive-select-column-with-non-alphanumeric-characters/35349822).
To work around this issue set the property `dots.in.keys` to `true` in the SerDe Properties and access these fields by
 substituting the period with an underscore.

For example, create the following table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable (
    my_field string,
    other struct<with_dots:string> )
    ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("dots.in.keys" = "true" )
```

Load the following JSON.

```
{ "my.field" : "value" , "other" : { "with.dots" : "blah" } }
```

Query data substituting periods with underscores.

```sql
SELECT my_field, other.with_dots from mytable

value, blah
```

### Case Sensitivity in mappings

Since hive is case insensitive, all JSON keys are by default lowercased, to accomodate
situations where the same JSON key is in a different case. 
However, this may not be what you want, you may need to treat the same key with different case
as two different ones. You'll then have to use mappings, since hive does not support case 
sensitive columns, and you'll also have to tell the SerDe not to be case insensitive (the default).

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable (  
  time1 string, 
  time2 string)
 ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES (
   "case.insensitive" = "false", --tells hive to ignore key case
   "mapping.time1"= "time", -- lowercase 'time' mapped into 'time1'
   "mapping.time2"= "Time") -- uppercase to 'time2'

-- Data: { "time" : "2012-10-22:, "Time": "2012-11-22"} 
SELECT time1,time2 from mytable
```

### Explicit Null Value In Serialized JSON String

In order to be complaint with some object oriented systems an explicit 'null' json value is required in the serialized string.
As default, Hive-JSON-Serde will not produce null values in the output serialized JSON string and just drop the key, if you do want to have explicit 'null' values in your output JSON string, use the following:

```
DROP TABLE tableWithNull;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE tableWithNull
(
    `stringCol` STRING,
    'stringNullCol' STRING,
    'stringMissingCol' STRING,
    'structCol' STRUCT<name : STRING>,
    'structNullCol' STRUCT<name : STRING>,
    'structMissingCol' STRUCT<name : STRING>
)
ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.openx.data.jsonserde.JsonSerDe'
WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ("explicit.null" = "true");

-- JSON string: {\"stringCol\":"blabla",\"stringNullCol\":null,\"structCol\":{\"name\":\"myName\"},\"structNullCol\":{\"name\":null}}
LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH 'pathToJsonFile.json' OVERWRITE INTO TABLE tableWithNull;

-- The output when ("explicit.null" = "true"):
-- {\"stringCol\":"blabla",\"stringNullCol\":null,\"stringMissingCol\":null,\"structCol\":{\"name\":\"myName\"},\"structNullCol\":{\"name\":null},\"structMissingCol\":null}

-- The default output or when ("explicit.null" = "false"):
-- {\"stringCol\":"blabla",\"structCol\":{\"name\":\"myName\"},\"structNullCol\":{}}
```


### User Defined Functions (UDF)

#### tjson

The `tjson` UDF can turn array, structs or strings into JSON.

```
ADD JAR json-udf-X.Y.Z-jar-with-dependencies.jar;
create temporary function tjson as 'org.openx.data.udf.JsonUDF';

hive> select tjson(named_struct("name",name)) from mytest1;
OK
{"name":"roberto"}
```

The SerDe must also be in the classpath for the UDF to work. If not installed
as a hive extra library, you should also `ADD JAR` theSerDe Jar

### Timestamps

Note that the system default timezone is used to convert timestamps.

### Releasing

This repository gets released to Maven Central.

- This repository requires JDK 11 to release/test. Without that you might see
  some tests fail when doing the release preventing you from being able to
  release.
- Make sure your `~/.m2/settings.xml` has an entry for `ossrh` server id.
  ```xml
  <settings>
      <!-- ... -->
      <servers>
          <!-- Sonatype Maven Release Repository -->
          <server>
              <id>ossrh</id>
              <username><!-- username for Maven Central --></username>
              <password><!-- password for Maven Central --></password>
          </server>
      </servers>
  </settings>
  ```
- Make sure you have a GPG keypair. See
  https://central.sonatype.org/publish/requirements/gpg/ for more instructions.
- Since the default branch of this repository cannot be pushed to you need to
  execute Maven release like so:
  ```sh
  ./mvnw release:clean release:prepare -DpushChanges=false
  ./mvnw release:perform -DlocalCheckout=true
  ```
- Once the above finishes follow the instructions at
  https://central.sonatype.org/publish/release/ to release to OSSRH so that it
  gets synced to Maven Central eventually. Note that this repository exists on
  https://oss.sonatype.org and not https://s01.oss.sonatype.org yet.
- After doing the "Release" in Sonatype create a new pull request with the 2
  commits that got created locally.
- Once the PR is merged tag the release commit using `git tag <tag>
  <commit_sha>` where `commit_sha` is the commit with message like
  `[maven-release-plugin] prepare release ...`.
- If the release fails with "inappropriate ioctl for device" then execute
  `export GPG_TTY=$(tty)` in the terminal where you are doing the release and
  retry.
