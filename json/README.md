# Open JSON
This code is extracted from the Android project to allow
a clean-room implementation of the popular JSON API to be
available under a free license as a small and independent
dependency.

The original library [1] is licensed under a standard BSD
license [2] with an additional line that requires the use of
the software only for "non-evil" purposes. Since this is
ill-defined, many downstream consumers of this software
find this license condition unacceptable. The moral is 
don't put jokes into legal documents.

Going forward, it would be good to look at the independent 
open-json project[3]. The goals of that project go beyond
the original goals for a drop-on replacement for the 
original json.org library.

# Acknowledgements

Thanks to the Android team for doing 99% of the work.

Thanks also to Simon Lessard for lending his critical eye 
and excellent suggestions.

Thanks to Tobias Soloschenko and Martin Grigorov with 
suggestions so open-json can help Wicket avoid the problem.
